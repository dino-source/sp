        operator/
        operator%
    assignment operator:
        operator=
    decrement operator:

    comparison operators:
        operator>
        operator<
        operator<=
        operator=>
        operator==
        operator!=
    extraction operator:
        operator>>
    increment operator:
        operator++
    insertion operator:
        operator<<
    scope resolution operator:
        operator::
    address-of operator:
        operator&
    subsript operator:
        operator[]
    call operator:
        operator()

Functions:
    function
    function call
    function declaration
    function definition
    function header
    function body
    function name
    function overloading
    function parameter list
    function parameters
    function return type
    passing parameters by reference
    passing parameters by value
    void functions

Statements:
    return statement

    compound statements:
        if statement
        if else statement
        nested if else statements
        switch statement
        do while loop
        while loop
        for loop
        range based for loop

Types:
    fundamental types (built-in types)
    built-in types: int, char, double, bool
    user-defined types:
        class
        enum
        enum class
        struct
        members of struct:
            data members
            member functions

Literals:
    boolean literals (true and false)
    char literals (single quoted characters like 'a' or '5')
    float pointing literals (like 3.14 or 2.5)
    integer literals (for example 42 or 777)
    string literals ("double quoted text")

Variables:
    variable declaration
    variable initialization
    value stored in variable

Separate compilation:
    header files
    source files
    file guards (#ifndef, #define, #endif pre-processor directives)
    pre-processor directives (#include)

Standard Library facilities:
    std::cout and std::cin objects from iostream header
    std::string type from <string> header
    std::vector type from <vector> header

Misc:
    block (code snippet between two curly braces)
    const qualifier
    escape sequences (\n \t \b \a \ " \r \v)
    expression
    keywords: auto, using, const, constexpr, return, struct, break and so on
    namespaces
