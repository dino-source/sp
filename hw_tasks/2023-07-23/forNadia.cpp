/*
Implement Dog class with the following data members:
1. breed (for example, "Siberian Husky")
2. name (for example, "Wolf")
3. date_of_birth (for example, "2015-08-25")
4. fur_color (for example, "white/black")
5. eyes_color (for example, "blue")
6. weight (for example, 23 kg)
7. height (for example, 52 cm)

Provide the following member functions:
1. eat()
2. sleep()
3. play()
4. sound()
5. info()

Use std::cout object to output dog status to console. Define std::vector of 4
objects of type Dog. Use range-based 'for' loop to visit each element of the
vector and output each dog info to console.
Dog member functions have to be defined with respect to constness (constant
member functions are those functions that are denied permission to change the
values of the data members of their class).
Use 'if-else' statement where applicable.
