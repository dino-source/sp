/*
Implement struct Car with the following data members:
1. brand (for example, "Audi")
2. model (for example, "A4")
3. year (for example, 2019)
4. color (for example, "white")
5. price (for example, $32000)
6. tank (you fill up car tank with fuel, so code out connection between 'tank'
data member and fill_up() member function)
7. max_speed (for examle, 260 km/h)

Provide the following member functions:
1. move()
2. stop()
3. fill_up()
4. info()

Use std::cout object to output car status to console. Define std::vector of 4
objects of type Car. Use range-based 'for' loop to visit each element of the
vector and output each car info to console.
Car member functions have to be defined with respect to constness (constant
member functions are those functions that are denied permission to change the
values of the data members of their class).
Use 'if-else' statement where applicable.
