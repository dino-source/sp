C++ studies using Stephen Prata's "C++ Primer Plus" (6th Edition)

## This course is to master one's skills in the following areas:

1) C++ programming language (C++ primer + code examples + code exercises)
2) Git (git console commands, VS Code git facilities)
3) GitHub (Github interface, commits, pull requests, code reviews)
4) VS Code (keyboard shorcuts, GUI)
5) Ubuntu (console commands, GUI, keyboard shorcuts)

## We're going to add to this list two more items later on:

6) Debugger
7) Build systems (Make, CMake)

English skills mastering is assumed as student's independent work.
